    power-management/rtc (LP: #1067692)
  * scripts/resolution_test - Slightly clarify output of script so that it's
    a bit more obvious why it failed (LP: #1065976)

    make it all look better. Verified perf code doesn't run on S4 tests.
    scripts/fwts_test - Added similar performance code to fwts_test.  Added
    sleep test functions to fwts_test to provide the ability to run sleep tests
    via fwts using the wrapper.  Tweaked the output to make it pretty. Added

    jobs/suspend.txt, jobs/stress.txt, jobs/hibernate.txt - modifed jobs to use
    the shell code to call fwts_test if fwts is installed and fall back to

    fail if the system took too long to sleep or resume. Also removed the 
    options to set sleep or resume time from sleep_test as they were no longer 
    necessary.
    jobs/hibernate.txt.in, jobs/suspend.txt.in, jobs/stress.txt.in - added
    environ: to the sleep jobs so the logs would be written properly. Modified
    suspend jobs to also write output to log files so we can capture timing
    data. Added jobs to parse the new sleep times logs and faile if outside the
    threshold.
    scripts/sleep_time_check - added script to check the logs generated by
    the sleept tests and fail if the average times exceed a given threshold
    po/POTFILES.in - changed the pcmcia-pcix.txt.in pointer to expresscard.txt.in
  * removed xorg_memory_test and graphics/xorg-memory as the test produces no
    real benefit and fails about 100% of the time. (LP: #764376)
  * scrips/volume_test - script now only fails if volume is greater than maxvol or
    less than minvol, not when equal to either. (LP: #1077008)
  * Added root user requirement to all jobs using removable storage test 
    (LP: #1014813)
  * scripts/alsa_info - updated script to latest version available 
    (LP: #1078837) 
  * jobs/mediacard.txt.in - fixed the depends for all *remove* mediacard tests
    to more properly depend on the insert tests rather than storage.

    which is not in the default install, and is not used anyway.
  * Better feedback from resolution_test script. Display the expected and

  * jobs/cpu.txt.in: added cpu_scaling_test log attachment job
  * jobs/disk.txt.in: modified block_device requirements so they'll work right
    jobs/info.txt.in: added block_device resource requirements to hdparm job so
    it won't run on removable stuff where it's not necessary.
  * jobs/info.txt.in: removed extraneous fwts_log job
    jobs/miscellanea.txt.in: modified fwts_results.log job
  * scripts/optical_detect: minor tweak to send error output to stderr
    scripts/optical_read_test: added root user check because this needs to be
    run with root privileges. Added some additional output for stderr for
    failures so we will know WHY a test or the script failed. Replaced 
    sys.stdout.write() and flush() calls with simple print statements.
  * scripts/ipmi_test: output tweaks so error messages now go to stderr. No BMC
    message is a little more clear. Module failed to load now generates an
    error rather than a simple exit.
  * scripts/network_device_info: minor change so that the fail message now
    specifies that it was an error and outputs to stderr properly.
  * scripts/disk_smart: Improvements to the logging and output during testing.
  * scripts/cpu_scaling_test: lots of output changes using logging module.
    renamed script to frequency_governors_test to be more descriptive and less
    confusing. Added a --log option to write logs to an actual file
    jobs/cpu.txt.in: added an attachment job to attach the freq_governors log.
    Modified cpu/frequency_governors to write to log file
  * scripts/cpu_offlining: added an extra bit of output in case of failures. 
  * scripts/fwts_test: improved console output so that the info displayed in
    submission.xml is more useful.
    jobs/power-management.txt.in: added job to attach fwts_wakealarm.log to
    results.
  * scripts/network_ntp_test: Tweaked output to use log levels more
    appropriately. Added some decoding so that bytes output show up as strings
    properly in output. Converted from optparse to argparse. Added a root
    check because this needs to be root to properly run.
  * scripts/disk_read_performance_test: Added extra targeted output so that
    users can understand what's going on. Moved the exit bits so the test will
    actuall run on multiple drives as originally intended and not exit on the
    first failure.
  * scripts/removable_storage_test: vastly improved the output from that script
    and also introduced some new error handling to cover a couple conditions
    that generated unhelpful tracebacks.
  * scripts/memory_compare: changed the output a little so failures now dump
    data to stderr and success to stdout. Also added a try/except block to
    catch possible ZeroDivisionError cases if dmi or meminfo return 0 (found on
    my local system due to a library issue)
  * jobs/power-management.txt.in: improved rtc and tickless idle tests to
    provide more useful output, even though they are very simple tests.
  * jobs/networking.txt.in: added some output to networking/multi_nic so a 
    failure due to unconfigured ifaces generates something beyond a blank line
  * scripts/cpu_topology: Changed it so there is less output on success and
    more useful output on failure. Fixed a bug in the test for Failure that
    caused the False condition to never be met.
  * scripts/network_bandwidth_test: fleshed out the output to make it a little
    more useful in both debug and info levels. Was going to set the
    networking/bandwidth job to debug, but the info output should now be
    sufficient to begin diagnosing test failures.
  * jobs/usb.txt.in: Added output to usb/detect in case no USB controllers are
    found. Added dependencies on the udisks package which may not be installed
    by default.
    debian/control: Added udisks as a suggests for checkbox as it's required
    for the USB tests to function.
  * scripts/memory_test: converted from optparse to argparse. Added some extra
    stderr output that may be useful if this test fails. redirected some
    existing error messages to stderr also
  * scripts/disk_stats_test: some minor changes to output. Also, error output
    now goes to stderr on test failure.

  [Marc Tardif]
  * Fixed duplicate jobs appearing in the store when rerunning jobs.
  * Fixed packaging to install scripts under /usr/lib.

  [Daniel Manrique]
  * Added a message file format test that does some simplistic checks
    on jobs/* files to ensure they are sane.
  * Fixed two typos in jobs/suspend.txt.in.
  * Merging of translations into job files prior to running message 
    file format test, to further ensure that translated strings
    and field descriptions are parsed correctly.
  * Explicit encoding of error strings in Job.execute, so that data returned
    is consistent and invokers of this method don't choke on it. (LP:
    #1024541)

  [Brendan Donegan]
  * Make a call to rfkill unblock in the create_connection script, incase
    those nasty Broadcom drivers have left a soft-block on the wireless after
    loading. Also do a bit of refactoring to use check_output and check_call
    instead of Popen (LP: #1019162)
  * Move the call to unblock to before the connection is created
  * Reimplemented memory_compare in python3 and restructured it to put
    things into dictionaries for easy access. Also fixed bug with detecting
    non-RAM devices as RAM. (LP: #960087)
  * Wait longer to get the window handle in gpu_test, so that we don't fall foul
    of timing issues. (LP: #1018563)
  * Catch exception raised in memory_compare by DMI RAM entries with No Module
    Installed in the Size field (LP: #1023220)
  * Also unblock wireless before wireless_scanning test, as I neglected to do
    this before. (LP: #1023619)
  * Replace Flash video playback with HTML5 video playback. This has better
    support in Ubuntu and is more relevant (LP: #1024078)

  [Sylvain Pineau]
  * Add the firmware version (BIOS or UEFI) to the XML report.

    * scripts/keyboard_test: nothing to do for conversion beyond changing shebang.
    * scripts/network_ntp_test: 2to3 changed nothing, so modified shebang.
      Fixed an encoding issue with Popen output in. Re-inserted a call to

    * scripts/pm_test: ran 2to3 and changed shebang. After a lot of trial and
      error, changed the way xinput is called to avoid confusing bytecode
      embedded in the command output that was causing problems with
      bytes.decode() on the "after reboot" hardware checks.
