Most of the Checkbox-related projects (Checkbox-NG, Plainbox, Checkbox
providers, etc.) are stored in one Bazaar repository.

You can grab a copy of the code by running:

    bzr branch lp:checkbox

All these projects will now be stored in a checkbox directory on your computer.

Make the modifications you want, and test them befoer submitting them.  You
should also ensure that you have the latest changes from upstream in your copy
of the checkbox repository.

    bzr pull
    bzr commit

If your changes fix an open bug (for instance bug #1552503), you can link your
commit to it:
    bzr commit --fixes lp:1552503

You'll have to write a commit title and message explaining what you changed.

For the title, we recommend prefixing it depending on the project you modified.
For instance, if you did some modifications in the Checkbox provider, your
commit title should look like:

    provider:checkbox: Fix fwts script

Once this is done, it's time to show your modifications to the World!

With Bazaar you can push your modifications to a personal branch like this:

    bzr push lp:~your-launchpad-id/checkbox/branch-title

For example, in my case:

    bzr push lp:~pierre-equoy/checkbox/fix-lp1552503-fwts_test

Once pushed, the branch will be visible in your Launchpad page at:
    https://code.launchpad.net/~

From there, you can propose your modifications to be merged in Checkbox main
repository (aka Checkbox trunk). Select the branch you just pushed, click on
“Propose for merging” and validate (the default choices should be the right
ones). This will create a merge proposal you can share with anyone so they can
review your modification and propose comments.

A notification will also be sent to the Checkbox team to review your
modifications and approve/comment on it.

I hope this little introduction is clear enough! If you have any questions,
please let me know here or come on our IRC channel (#checkbox on Freenode) and
ask around!
