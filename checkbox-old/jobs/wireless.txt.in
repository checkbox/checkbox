 PURPOSE:
     This test will check your wireless connection.
 STEPS:
     1. Click on the Network icon in the panel.
     2. Select a network below the 'Wireless networks' section.
     3. Click "Test" to verify that it's possible to establish an HTTP connection.
 VERIFICATION:
     Did a notification show and was the connection correctly established?

     security and the 802.11b/g protocols.
 STEPS:
     1. Open your routers configuration tool
     2. Change the settings to only accept connections on the B and G wireless bands
     3. Make sure the SSID is set to ROUTER_SSID
     4. Change the security settings to use WPA2 and ensure the PSK matches that set in ROUTER_PSK
     5. Click the 'Test' button to create a connection to the router and test the connection
