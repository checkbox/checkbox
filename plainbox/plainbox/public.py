============================================

Public, high-level API for third party developers.

The are actually implemented by the plainbox.impl package. This module is here
so that the essential API concepts are in a single spot and are easier to
understand (by not being mixed with additional source code).

.. warning::

    This module is ironically UNSTABLE until the 1.0 release

.. note::

    This module has API stability guarantees. We are not going to break or
    introduce backwards incompatible interfaces here without following our API
    deprecation policy. All existing features will be retained for at least
    three releases. All deprecated symbols will warn when they will cease to be
    available.
