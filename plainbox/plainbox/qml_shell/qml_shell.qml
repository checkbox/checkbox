/*! \brief QML standalone shell

    This component serves as QML shell that embeds native QML plainbox jobs.
    The job it loads is specified by --job argument passed to qmlscene
    launching this component.
    Job to be run must have testingShell property that be used as a hook to
    'outside world'. The job should also define testDone signal that gets
    signalled once test is finished. The signal should pass result object
    containing following fields:
    'outcome' (mandatory): outcome of a test, e.g. 'pass', 'fail', 'undecided'.
    'suggestedOutcome': if outcome is 'undecided', than this suggestion will be
    presented to the user, letting them decide the final outcome of a test.
