    Base class for transports that send test data somewhere.

    They handle just the transmission portion of data sending; exporters are
    expected to produce data in the proper format (e.g. json, xml).

    Each transport can have specific parameters that are required for the
    other end to properly process received information (like system
    identification, authorization data and so on), and that don't semantically
    belong in the test data as produced by the exporter. Additionally
    each transport needs to be told *where* to send test data. This is
    transport-dependent; things like a HTTP endpoint, IP address, port
    are good examples.
