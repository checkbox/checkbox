    Public API decorator generator.

    This decorator serves multiple uses:

        * It clearly documents all public APIs. This is visible to
          both developers reading the source code directly and to people
          reading code documentation (by adjusting __doc__)

        * It provides a stable import location while allowing to move the
          implementation around as the code evolves. This unbinds the name and
          documentation of the symbol from the code.

        * It documents when each function was introduced. This is also visible
          in the generated documentation.

        * It documents when each function will be decommissioned. This is
          visible in the generated documentation and at runtime. Each initial
          call to a deprecated function will cause a PendingDeprecationWarnings
          to be logged.

    The actual implementation of the function must be in in a module specified
    by import_path. It can be a module name or a module name and a function
    name, when separated by a colon.
