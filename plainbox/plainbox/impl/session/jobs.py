:mod:`plainbox.impl.session.jobs` -- jobs state handling
========================================================

This module contains a helper class for associating job state within a
particular session. The :class:`JobState` class holds references to a
:class:`JobDefinition` and :class:`JobResult` as well as a list of inhibitors
that prevent the job from being runnable in a particular session.

class JobReadinessInhibitor:
    """
    Class representing the cause of a job not being ready to execute.

    It is intended to be consumed by UI layers and to provide them with enough
    information to render informative error messages or other visual feedback
    that will aid the user in understanding why a job cannot be started.

    There are four possible not ready causes:

        UNDESIRED:
            This job was not selected to run in this session

        PENDING_DEP:
           This job depends on another job which was not started yet

        FAILED_DEP:
            This job depends on another job which was started and failed

        PENDING_RESOURCE:
            This job has a resource requirement expression that uses a resource
            produced by another job which was not started yet

        FAILED_RESOURCE:
            This job has a resource requirement that evaluated to a false value

    All causes apart from UNDESIRED use the related_job property to encode a
    job that is related to the problem. The PENDING_RESOURCE and
    FAILED_RESOURCE causes also store related_expression that describes the
    relevant requirement expression.

    There are three attributes that can be accessed:

        cause:
            Encodes the reason why a job is not ready, see above.

        related_job:
            Provides additional context for the problem. This is not the job
            that is affected, rather, the job that is causing the problem.

        related_expression:
            Provides additional context for the problem caused by a failing
            resource expression.
    """
    # XXX: PENDING_RESOURCE is not strict, there are multiple states that are
    # clumped here which is something I don't like. A resource may be still
    # "pending" as in PENDING_DEP (it has not ran yet) or it could have ran but
    # failed to produce any data, it could also be prevented from running
    # because it has unmet dependencies. In essence it tells us nothing about
    # if related_job.can_start() is true or not.
    #
    # XXX: FAILED_RESOURCE is "correct" but somehow misleading, FAILED_RESOURCE
    # is used to represent a resource expression that evaluated to a non-True
