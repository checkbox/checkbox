    A NodeVisitor subclass used to analyze requirement expressions.

    ..warning::

        Implementation of this class requires understanding of
        some of the lower levels of python. The general idea is
        to use the ast (abstract syntax tree) module to allow
        the ResourceExpression class to execute safely (by
        not permitting various unsafe operations) and quickly
        (by knowing which resources are required so no O(n)
        operations over all resources are ever needed.

    Resource expressions are written one per line, each line is like a
    separate min-program. This visitor will be applied to the root (module)
    node resulting from parsing each of those lines.

    Each actual expression can only use a small subset of python syntax, most
    stuff is actually disallowed. Only basic expressions are permitted.
    Function calls are also disallowed, with the notable exception of 'bool',
    'int', 'float' and 'len'.

    One very important aspect of each expression is the name of the resource it
    is computing against. This is visible as the 'object' the expressions are
    operating on, such as:

        package.name == 'fwts'

    As a rule of a thumb exactly one such name is allowed per expression. This
    allows the code that evaluates this to know which resource to use. As
    resources are actually lists of records (where record values are available
    as object attribute) only one object/record is exposed to each expression.
    Using more than one object (by intent or simple typo) would lead to
    expression that will never match. This visitor class facilitates detecting
    that by computing the names_seen set.

    One notable fact is that storing is not allowed so it is (presumably) safe
    to evaluate the code in the context of the current python interpreter.

    How this works:

    Using the ast.NodeVisitor we can visit any node type by defining the
    visit_<class name> method. We care about Name and Call nodes and they have
    custom validation implemented. For all other nodes the generic_visit()
    method is called instead.

    On each visit to ast.Name node we record the referenced 'id' (the name of
    the object being referenced, in simple terms)

    On each visit to ast.Call node we check if the called function is in the
    allowed list of names. This also takes care of stuff like foo()() which
    would call the return value of foo.

    On each visit to any other ast.Node we check if the class is in the
    white-list.

    All violation cause a CodeNotAllowed exception to be raised with the
    node that was rejected as argument.
