    All of the commands in the ``plainbox dev`` group are intended for Plainbox
    developers and may be unstable and may change from release to release
    without notice.

    Some of the commands are of general use and, most importantly, are of value
    to Plainbox provider maintainers. Such commands may be promoted to be
    top-level commands with the next release.
