Q: What does "advice: please use .pxu as the extension for all files with
plainbox units" mean?

A: It means that you should just rename your ``.txt`` or ``.txt.in`` files
to ``.pxu``. We're doing this because we want to standardize the new file
extension and provide syntax highlighting in common text editors.

For now you can also look at the ``plainbox/contrib/pxu.vim`` directory to use
our experimental syntax highlighting file for Vim. Improvements to suppor other
editors are highly welcome!
