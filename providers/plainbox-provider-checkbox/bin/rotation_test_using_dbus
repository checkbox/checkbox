# This script is used to trigger a main screen rotation directly from DBUS to
# simulate the way screen rotation is done when using System Settings screen.
# Indeed, when using xrandr command or Python lib, we sometimes have weird
# behaviours, specifically when used with NVidia cards with proprietary drivers.
