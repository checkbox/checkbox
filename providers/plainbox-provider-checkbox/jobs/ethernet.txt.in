 PURPOSE:
     This test will check your wired connection
 STEPS:
     1. Click on the Network icon in the top panel
     2. Select a network below the "Wired network" section
     3. Click "Test" to verify that it's possible to establish a HTTP connection
 VERIFICATION:
     Did a notification show and was the connection correctly established?

  PURPOSE:
      User verification of whether the observed transfer throughput is acceptable
      for the type and maximum speed of each ethernet interface.
  STEPS:
      1. Click "Test".
      2. Read the network test summary and confirm that the throughput is acceptable.
      3. If needed, click "Test" again to repeat the transfer test.
  VERIFICATION:
     Was the reported throughput acceptable for the type and maximum speed of this interface?
