## This whitelist is intended for use inside Canonical's test labs.  The tests
## conained in this list are the same as those contained in the
## client-selftest.whitelist file that OEMs may use. The difference here is that
## some of these tests depend on a specific network environment and may not run
## properly in your test environment.  To avoid false failures, please use the 
## client-selftest.whitelist instead.
# Meta-job to include required resources, don't remove.
