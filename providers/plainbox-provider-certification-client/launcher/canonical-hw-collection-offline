#!/usr/bin/env checkbox-launcher
# The purpose of this launcher is to gather information about the hardware
# and save it to a local file for later manual collection.
#
# 1- It will just show a welcome screen and prompt for password at the
#    beginning.
# 2- It will run all the jobs in the hwsubmit whitelist. They're all
#    automated and very short, just to collect system data.
# 3- It will save the resulting files/reports in a location under
#    $HOME/.local, to be indicated when the tool finishes running.
