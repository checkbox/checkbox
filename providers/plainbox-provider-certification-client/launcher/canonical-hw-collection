#!/usr/bin/env checkbox-launcher
# The purpose of this launcher is to gather information about the hardware
# and submit it to HEXR (Hardware Enablement Cross Referencer).
# 1- It will just show a welcome screen and prompt for password at the
#    beginning.
# 2- It will run all the jobs in the hwsubmit whitelist. They're all
#    automated and very short, just to collect system data.
# 3- It will prompt whether to submit to hexr
# 4- Upon confirmation it will upload data to hexr and provide a URL
#    to complete adding the system. No secure_id is needed.
# 5- Once the URL is provided it will exit.
