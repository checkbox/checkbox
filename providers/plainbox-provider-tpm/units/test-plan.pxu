_name: TPM (Trusted Platform Module) Smoke Tests
_description:
 This test plan contains simple tests for the TPM chip. The tests will ensure
 that the TPM chip is present, is visible by the OS and that ownership over the
 chip can be taken.
 .
 After testing, a number of logs are collected for additional analysis.

 # Vendor-specific, interactive recovery process. We want to educate the tester
 # how they can reset the TPM chip from unknown state using vendor-specific
 # instructions.

 # Disabled) to Active where we can perform useful tests.

 # The first thing we want to try is to clear the ownership of the TPM chip
 # This will let us ensure that all the other tests are independent of any
 # ownership or data already stored there.

 # Next we want to take the ownership of the chip.

 # Finally, with the TPM chip owned, we can perform some simple query jobs and

_name: Collect TPM (Trusted Platform Module) Information
_description:
 This test plan contains a selection of jobs that collect various bits of
 information about a TPM chip. They are designed to run with an owned TPM chip
 that uses well-known (20 zero bytes) owner key.
 .
 This test plan is not interactive, apart from the manifest collection step.

 # Then collect all of the information
