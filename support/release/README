Prerequisites:

    sudo apt-get install autoconf lptools python-bs4

Always maintain 3 milestones ahead

    Use the lp-create-milestone script like this:

    ./lp-create-milestone plainbox -n 0.57 -d 2015-11-24

Check bugs in checkbox-project to see if they can be included i nthe release
to come. Some of them could be "In Progress" but with the fix already merged
in trunk. Update their statuses and milestones.

Review the current miletones content and postpone to the next one the bugs
not "Fix Committed".

Cutting the release

Preparation:

Create a dedicated directory that you will keep during all the release (1 week).

    mkdir ~/checkbox_release

Copy all the delivery support scripts to the release directory:

    bzr export /tmp/delivery_tools lp:checkbox
    cp /tmp/delivery_tools/support/release/* ~/checkbox_release

Move to the release directory

    cd ~/checkbox_release

Cut the release, change all package versions to RC and create/apply bzr tags
for the release candidate.

    ./checkbox-release.py testing

Follow the on-screen instructions given when the scripts ends as nothing will be
pushed to lp automatically:

    1. Push all the branches (trunk and ppa-packaging*) to their release branches
       Copy and launch the proposed commands once you're sure that the branches
       are ok, check versions and tags (for both trunk and packaging branches)
    2. Update the bzr build recipes and request builds in the testing ppa (link)
       Give lp a minute or two before updating the recipes. Again copy and
       execute the proposed commands.

Special case: Cherry pick a bugfix from trunk after having cut the release:

    A second (or third...) release candidate has to be created for the
    impacted package:
    First, cherry pick the bug from trunk, e.g:

    cd ~/checkbox_release/trunk/
    bzr merge -r3105..3106 lp:checkbox
    cd  ~/checkbox_release

    Note: 3106 is the revision where the fix was committed

    Create a second RC only for this package (and its packaging branch):

    ./releasectl ppa-packaging-plainbox-provider-resource-generic --origin=trunk --in-place --current-version=0.5c1 --bump-level=next-serial
    ./releasectl ppa-packaging-plainbox-provider-resource-generic --origin=ppa-packaging-plainbox-provider-resource-generic  --in-place --current-version=0.5c1 --bump-level=next-serial

    Push the branches to lp:

    bzr push -d trunk lp:~checkbox-dev/checkbox/release
    bzr push -d ppa-packaging-plainbox-provider-resource-generic lp:~checkbox-dev/checkbox/ppa-packaging-plainbox-provider-resource-generic-release

    Finally update the recipe(s) and build again the package(s)

TEST TEST TEST the release candidate(s)

Once testing is done, it's time to release the candidate packages to the stable ppa (link)

change all package versions to final, create/apply the corresponding bzr
tags and update the debian/changelog (closing the current entry and open the
next dev version)

Move to the release directory and launch the release script:

    cd ~/checkbox_release && ./checkbox-release.py stable

Follow the on-screen instructions given when the scripts ends as nothing will be
pushed to lp automatically:

    1. Push all the branches (trunk and ppa-packaging*) to their release branches
       Copy and launch the proposed commands once you're sure that the branches
       are ok, check versions and tags (for both trunk and packaging branches)
    2. Propose to merge the release branches into their non-release branch
       (e.g lp:checkbox/release has to be merged in trunk)
       Review the MR, approve and let tarmac do his job.
    3. Once all release branches are merged, update the bzr build recipes
       and request builds in the stable ppa (link).
       Again copy and execute the proposed commands.
    4. Release all the milestones and their related bugtasks, e.g:

       ./lp-release-milestone plainbox -m 0.57

Create source tarballs, sign and upload them to lp (using lp-project-upload)
and pypi.
Note: Revert to the final tag revision to ensure that you're not creating a
source tarball with ~dev version in setup.py (this will be fixed in a new
version of the delivery tools)

Release to debian
