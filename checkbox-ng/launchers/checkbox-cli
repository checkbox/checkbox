text = Welcome to System Testing!
    Checkbox provides tests to confirm that your system is working properly.
    Once you are finished running the tests, you can view a summary report for
    your system and submit your results to Launchpad.
    Warning: Some tests could cause your system to freeze or become
    unresponsive. Please save all your work and close all other running
    applications before beginning the testing process.
