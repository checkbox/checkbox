Checkbox Enhancement Proposals
==============================

All of the documents listed here are proposals to improve the Checkbox stack in
one way or another. They serve as public reference and as a vehicle for
discussion before and during the time that such improvements are developed.

Creating new CEPs
=================

Each proposal should follow the following structure:

 - A **summary** section briefly describes the change.
 - A **rationale** explains why the change is useful or necessary.
 - An **impact** section explains how this feature affects the stack as it
   exists at the time the CEP is written. This section must specifically cover
   any backwards compatibility issues, if the proposal is introducing any. 
 - Additional sections may go into details of the feature, provide examples,
   etc. The authors should feel unconstrained to add useful and interesting
   material.

To allocate a number, please propose a merge request with the new CEP. This
will prevent any collisions as CEPs get merged into trunk.
