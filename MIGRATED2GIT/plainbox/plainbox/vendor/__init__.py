:mod:`plainbox.vendor` -- vendorized packages
=============================================

This module contains external packages that were vendorized (shipped with a
tree of another project) to simplify dependency management. There is no problem
with expressing those dependencies at pypi level but it would be annoying to
have to first package and introduce them to Ubuntu.
