Providers
=========

Providers are a new feature introduced in Plainbox 0.5. They allow third party
developers to produce and maintain private and public test collections.

All :term:`jobs <job>` and :term:`whitelists <whitelist>` are now loaded from a provider. This
also affects the :term:`Checkbox` project that now produces a custom user
interface and a number of providers for various purposes.
